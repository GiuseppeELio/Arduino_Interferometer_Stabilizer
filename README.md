# Arduino_Interferometer_Stabilizer
An open hardware/source and low-cost interferometer stabilizer equipped with a digital lock-in amplifier.

The proposed firmware control a specific arduino Giga R1 shield designed to operate as function of the input signal coming from an interferometer where a piezo-electric mirror is direcly controlled by the Piezo DAC output (from the same board). The code is also embedded in different GUIs (Matlab and Python) or in Standalone applications made for Win and Mac Os.
